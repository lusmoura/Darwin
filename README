                                      Darwin
                             INSTALL AND USAGE GUIDE
-----------------------------------INSTALL--------------------------------------
Darwin uses the following libraries:
    -Numpy
    -Pandas
    -Sci Kit Learn
    -MatPlotLib
To install these libraries just type the following commands on your terminal
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    pip3 install numpy
    pip3 install pandas
    pip3 install sklearn
    pip3 install matplotlib
    or just type
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
-------------------------------------USAGE--------------------------------------
The Darwin commands are:

>Load [file]: Loads data from [file]
>print data: prints loaded data
>plot data: plots data
>Params: Print the environment parameters
>Set clusters x: sets the amount of clusters to x
>Set population x: sets the number of individuals to x
>Set selection x: Sets selection type to x
>Set generations x: sets the number of generations to x
>Set mutation x: sets mutation rate to x
>init: initializes population
>evolve: evolves the population
>plot clusters: Prints data, now clustered
>std: scales data to achieve zero mean and unit variance (use before loading data)
>Compare: Plots comparison graph between the different selection methods
>ignore lines x: skips x lines from the csv
>ignore columns x: ignores the x last columns
>quit: quits the program

Remeber, if you don't know what to do, just type help.

Step-by-step guide:
  1)Set which lines and columns you want to be ignored with the commands ignore lines x and ignore columns x.
    The columns will be ignored counting from right to the left and the lines will be ignored counting from top to bottom.
  to ignore certain data such as headers
  2)Load the csv file with the command Load file.csv, the loaded data will be printed afterwards
  3)Set the parameters with the set commands, remember you will have to initialize the population every time you change a parameter.
    You can also see the current parameters with the command params.
  4)Evolve your population with the command evolve. It will evolve according to the selection method previously set (default selection: roulette).
  5)Initialize again the population with the command init and compare every selection method with the command compare.
  6)You can check all graphs plotted in the graphs folder that has been created on the same directory in which Darwin is installed.
